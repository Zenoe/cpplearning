* makefile
** all: program
Here, all is the default target (because it's listed first).

When you run make, it's equivalent to make all.

This means: “to build all, make program.”

👉 So the first rule is always the one executed if you don't specify a target.

** A phony target is a name for a rule that doesn’t represent a real file.
It’s just a label for a command you want to run, like clean, install, all, etc.

Problem:
If you have a file named clean in the directory, and you type make clean, Make will think it’s already done because the file exists.

Fix:
Use .PHONY to tell Make "this is not a file — always run this rule".

** make -B stdafx.h.gch
force a rebuld gch
